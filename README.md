# Python automation testing basics
Understanding the basics with data driven UI testing with Python, [Selenium](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium) &amp; [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

Note: '[nose](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)' is used only for standalone execution. As I use PyCharm with '[pydev](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/help/remote-debugging.html)' support for debugging I am actually not using it.
